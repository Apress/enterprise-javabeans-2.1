<p>&quot;..interface between an entity bean and the EJB container..&quot; should
read &quot;..interface between an Enterprise Bean and the EJB container..&quot;</p>
<h4>Page 44: </h4>
<p>The final paragraph should read:</p>
<p>As we have already mentioned, an Enterprise Bean uses either local or remote
interfaces. The implementation class of the of the home or local home interface
is usually called EJBHome, while that of the local or remote interface is
usually known as EJBObject. The classes EJBHome and EJBObject are generated from
the components of a bean by the tools of the container's creator.</p>
